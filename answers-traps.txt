the arguments are saved in registers a0, a1, a2 and so on. argument 3 was saved in a2
the line is
26:	45b1                	li	a1,12
the compiler is smart enough to do f(8) + 1 = g(8) + 1 = 8 + 3 + 1 = 12 in advance
printf is in adress 1552, (0x640 in hex)
the value in ra is the return adress to main (0x34)
the output is HE110 World
to make it work in big endian i would flip the bytes in i (so i = 0x726c6400)
and i would change i to 186 which is 0x011E in hex
the value is whatever is in register a2 because printf expects another arguments aand uses the place tha the answer should apear in
