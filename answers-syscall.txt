syscall was called by kernel/trap.c in line 67
p->trapframe->a7 represents the syscall number (in the enum)
the previous mode was 0x200000022
the assembly instruction is: lw	s3,0(zero) # 0 <_entry-0x80000000>
num corresponds to register s3
address 0 is not in the kernel address space and because of that when it tries to load from there it panics
the binary that ran was initcode and the pid was 0
